# hello-world
First Test Repository
This is a test of ysing Github as a way to store code changes and share them with others. I want to master Web Development and hope that Github can be a tool to allow others to view my progress and offer potential help as I proceed.

The other thing I want to be able to do is to use Github to develop new ideas while leaving the main code intact.
